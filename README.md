# A.T.L.A.S.
ATLAS aka **ASCII Text Line Art System** aka **American Standard Code for Information Interchange Text Line Art System** 

## Overview
A.T.L.A.S. is a powerful and elegant tool that transforms images into intricate ASCII art, embodying the strength and vision of the Titan Atlas from Greek mythology, who carried the weight of the world. Just as Atlas mapped the heavens (slight reach here) , A.T.L.A.S. maps pixel data into the structured, timeless medium of ASCII, creating digital art through the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. This project bridges the visual and textual realms, rendering images as expressive line art with precision and creativity.
